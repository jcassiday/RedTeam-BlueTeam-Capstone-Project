# RedTeam-BlueTeam-Capstone-Project

For this project, I was a Red Team member that attack a vulnerable VM and gain root access to the machine. Then as a Blue Team member, review ELK logs and come up with mitigating strategies. The project showed how logs from the ELK server can help SOC and the Network Security Team come up with mitigating strategies.
